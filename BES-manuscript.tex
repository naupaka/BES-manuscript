\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

A key component of constraining the uncertainty of the terrestrial
carbon sink is quantification of terrestrial soil carbon fluxes, which
vary across time and ecosystem type. One method for the estimation of
these fluxes and their associated uncertainties is the flux gradient
method, which can be calculated via a variety of existing approaches.
Robust estimation of soil carbon fluxes on a sub-daily level requires
measurements of soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, water content,
temperature, and other environmental measurements and soil properties.
These data are publicly available from the National Ecological
Observatory Network at sites spanning a range of 20 different
ecoclimatic domains across the continental United States, Puerto Rico,
Alaska, and Hawai'i. We present an R software package
(\texttt{neonSoilFlux}) that acquires NEON soil environmental data and
computes soil carbon flux at a half-hourly time step at a user-specified
NEON site and month in a tidy data format. To validate the computed
fluxes, we visited six focal NEON sites and measured soil carbon fluxes
using a closed-dynamic chamber approach. The validation confirmed that a
primary challenge in reducing soil carbon flux uncertainty is correctly
characterizing diffusivity and soil water content across the soil
profile. Outputs from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package contribute to
existing databases of soil carbon flux measurements, providing near
real-time estimates of a critical component of the terrestrial carbon
cycle.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Soils contain the largest reservoir of terrestrial carbon (Jobbágy \&
Jackson, 2000). A critical component of this reservoir is soil organic
matter, the accumulation of which is influenced by biotic factors such
as above-ground plant inputs (Jackson et al., 2017). These inputs in
turn are influenced by environmental factors such as growing season
length, temperature, and moisture (Desai et al., 2022), which also
affect the breakdown of soil organic matter and its return to the
atmosphere. Across heterogeneous terrestrial landscapes, the interplay
between these biotic and abiotic factors influence the size of the soil
contribution to the terrestrial carbon sink (Friedlingstein et al.,
2023). However, the heterogeneity of these processes across diverse
ecosystems in the context of rapid environmental change leads to large
uncertainty in the magnitude of this sink in the future, and thus a
pressing need to quantify changes in soil carbon pools and fluxes across
scales.

Ecological observation networks such as the United States' National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and others (e.g.~FLUXNET or the
Integrated Carbon Observation System) present a significant advancement
in the nearly continuous observation of biogeochemical processes at the
continental scale. Notably, at 47 terrestrial sites across the
continental United States, NEON provides half-hourly measurements of
soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, temperature, and moisture at different
vertical depths. Each of these NEON sites also encompasses measurements
of the cumulative sum of all ecosystem carbon fluxes in an airshed using
the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi, 2014). Soil observations
provided by NEON are on the same timescale and standardized with eddy
covariance measurements from FLUXNET. These types of nearly continuous
observational data (NEON and FLUXNET) can be used to reconcile
differences between model-derived or data-estimated components of
ecosystem carbon flux (Jian et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2011; Phillips et
al., 2017; J. Shao et al., 2015; P. Shao et al., 2013; Sihi et al.,
2016).

Estimated or observed soil carbon fluxes are a key metric for
understanding change in soil carbon pools over time (Bond-Lamberty et
al., 2024). A soil carbon flux to the atmosphere (\(F_{S}\), units
\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\)), represents the aggregate process of
transfer of soil CO\(_{2}\) to the atmosphere from physical and
biological processes (e.g.~diffusion and respiration). Soil carbon
fluxes can be assumed to encompass soil carbon respiration from
autotrophic or heterotrophic sources (Davidson et al., 2006), typically
assumed to be static across the soil biome and modeled with a
exponential \(Q_{10}\) paradigm (Bond-Lamberty et al., 2004; Chen \&
Tian, 2005; Hamdi et al., 2013).

One method by which \(F_{S}\) is measured in the field is through the
use of soil chambers in a closed, well-mixed system (Norman et al.,
1997) with headspace trace gas concentrations measured with an infrared
gas analyzer (IRGA). \(F_{S}\) can also be estimated from soil
CO\(_{2}\) measurements at different depths in the soil using the
flux-gradient method (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014). This method is an
approach that uses conservation of mass to calculate flux at a vertical
soil depth \(z\) at steady state by applying Fick's law of diffusion. A
simplifying assumption for the flux-gradient method is that there is no
mass transfer in the other spatial dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) (Maier \&
Schack-Kirchner, 2014). The diffusivity profile, a key component of this
calculation, varies across the soil depth as a function of soil
temperature, soil volumetric water content, atmospheric air pressure,
and soil bulk density (Millington \& Shearer, 1971; Moldrup et al.,
1999; Sallam et al., 1984).

Databases such as the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) or the Continuous
Soil Respiration Database (COSORE) add to the growing network of
resources for making collected observations of soil fluxes available to
other workers (Bond-Lamberty, 2018; Bond-Lamberty et al., 2020;
Bond-Lamberty \& Thomson, 2010; Jian et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2024).
However, these databases currently encompass primarily direct soil
measurements of fluxes (i.e.~those using methods like the closed-chamber
method described above). Currently, NEON provides all measurements to
calculate \(F_{S}\) from Fick's law, but soil flux as a derived data
product was descoped from the initial network launch due to budget
constraints (Berenbaum et al., 2015). Deriving estimates of \(F_{S}\)
using continuous sensor data across NEON sites thus represents a high
priority.

This study describes an R software package, \texttt{neonSoilFlux}, that
can be used to derive a standardized estimate of \(F_{S}\) at all
terrestrial NEON sites. After calculating these flux estimates, we then
validated them against direct chamber-based field observations of soil
carbon dioxide flux from a subset of terrestrial NEON sites spanning six
states.

Key objectives of this study are to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Apply the flux-gradient method to estimate soil CO\(_{2}\) flux from
  continuous sensor measurements across NEON sites.
\item
  Benchmark estimated soil carbon fluxes against field measurements
  (e.g.~direct chamber measurements of soil flux).
\item
  Identify sources of error in the flux-gradient approach across diverse
  sites in order to guide future work.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}

\subsection{Field methods}\label{field-methods}

\subsubsection{Focal NEON Sites}\label{focal-neon-sites}

In order to acquire field data to validate model predictions of flux, we
selected six terrestrial NEON sites for analysis. We conducted field
measurement campaigns at these sites, which span a range of
environmental gradients and terrestrial domains
(Table~\ref{tbl-neon-sites}). SJER, SRER, and WREF were visited during
May and June of 2022, and WOOD, KONZ, and UNDE during May and June of
2024.

Over the course of two field campaigns in 2022 and 2024, we conducted
week-long visits at each site. In consultation with NEON field staff, we
first selected a specific plot in the soil sampling array to maximize
the concurrent availability of sensor data.

\subsubsection{Soil collar placement}\label{soil-collar-placement}

Either one (2022 sampling campaign) or two (2024 sampling campaign) PVC
soil collars (20.1 cm inside diameter) were installed in close proximity
to the permanent NEON soil sensors at each site
(Figure~\ref{fig-collar-images}). The soil plot where measurements were
taken was chosen at each site in consultation with NEON staff to
maximize likelihood of quality soil sensor measurements during the
duration of the IRGA measurements at each site. After installation,
collar(s) were left to equilibrate for approximately 24 hours prior to
measurements being taken.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Infrared gas analyzer measurements of
soil CO\(_{2}\)
flux}{Infrared gas analyzer measurements of soil CO\_\{2\} flux}}\label{infrared-gas-analyzer-measurements-of-soil-co_2-flux}

In 2022, we then made measurements of flux on an hourly interval for 8
hours each day. Measurements were taken from roughly 8 am to 4 pm, with
the time interval selected to capture the majority of the diurnal
gradient of soil temperature each day. These measurements were made
using a LI-6800 infrared gas analyzer instrument (LI-COR Environmental,
Lincoln, NE) fitted with a soil chamber attachment (attachment 6800-09).
In 2024, we again used the same LI-6800 instrument, but made half-hourly
measurements over an approximately 8 hour period. In addition, we also
installed a second collar and used a second instrument, an LI-870
CO\(_{2}\) IRGA, connected to an automated robotic chamber (LI-COR
chamber 8200-104) controlled by an LI-8250 multiplexer, to make
automated measurements. The multiplexer was configured to take
half-hourly measurements 24 hours a day for the duration of our sampling
bout at each site. Each instrument was paired with a soil temperature
and moisture probe (Stevens HydraProbe, Stevens Water, Portland, OR)
that was used to make soil temperature and moisture measurements
concurrent with the CO\(_{2}\) flux measurements. Chamber volumes were
set by measuring collar offsets at each site. System checks were
conducted daily for the LI-6800 and weekly for the LI-8250. Instruments
were factory calibrated before each field season.

\subsubsection{Post-collection processing of field
data}\label{post-collection-processing-of-field-data}

We used LI-COR SoilFluxPro software (v 5.3.1) to assess the data after
collection and to inform sampling parameters. We checked appropriateness
of dead band and measurement durations using built-in evaluation tools.
Based on this, the deadband period was set for 30-40 seconds, depending
on the site, and the measurement duration was 180 seconds with a 30
second pre-purge and a 30 second post-purge at most sites, and a 90 sec
pre- and post-purge at sites with higher humidity due to recent
precipitation events. We also assessed the R\(^{2}\) of linear and
exponential model fits to measured CO\(_{2}\) to verify measurement
quality.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package}{neonSoilFlux R package}}\label{neonsoilflux-r-package}

We developed an R package (\texttt{neonSoilFlux};
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neonSoilFlux) to compute half-hourly
soil carbon fluxes and uncertainties from NEON data. The objective of
the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package is a unified workflow
(Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram}) for soil data acquisition and
analysis that supplements the existing data acquisition R package
\texttt{neonUtilities} (LINK TO BE ADDED AFTER PEER REVIEW).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{figures/neonSoilFluxOutline.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-package-diagram}Diagram of \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package. For a given month, year, and NEON site (orange parallelogram),
the package acquires all relevant data to compute \(F_{S}\) using the
\texttt{neonUtilities} R package (green rectangle). Data are gap-filled
according to reported QA flags and interpolated to the same measurement
depth before computing the soil flux, uncertainties, and final QA flags
(blue rectangles). The package reports the associated soil flux,
uncertainties, and quality assurance (QA) flags for the user (purple
parallelogram).}

\end{figure}%

At a given NEON observation there are five replicate soil plots, each
with measurements of soil CO\(_{2}\) concentration, soil temperature,
and soil moisture at different depths (Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}).
The \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package acquires measured soil water content
(National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024e), soil CO\(_{2}\)
concentration (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024b),
barometric pressure from the nearby tower (National Ecological
Observatory Network (NEON), 2024a), soil temperature (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024d), and soil properties
(e.g.~bulk density) (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON),
2024c). The static soil properties were collected from a nearby soil pit
during site characterization and are assumed to be constant at each
site.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{figures/model-diagram.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-model-diagram}Model diagram for data workflow for
the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R package. a) Acquire: Data are obtained from
given NEON location and horizontal sensor location, which includes soil
water content, soil temperature, CO\(_{2}\) concentration, and
atmospheric pressure. All data are screened for quality assurance; if
gap-filling of missing data occurs, it is flagged for the user. b) Any
belowground data are then harmonized to the same depth as CO\(_{2}\)
concentrations using linear regression. c) The flux across a given depth
is computed via Fick's law, denoted with \(F_{ijk}\), where \(i\),
\(j\), or \(k\) are either 0 or 1 denoting the layers the flux is
computed across (\(i\) = closest to surface, \(k\) = deepest).
\(F_{000}\) represents a flux estimate where the gradient \(dC/dz\) is
the slope of a linear regression of CO\(_{2}\) with depth.}

\end{figure}%

The workflow to compute a value of \(F_{S}\) with \texttt{neonSoilFlux}
consists of three primary steps, illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}. First, NEON data are acquired for a
given site and month via the \texttt{neonUtilities} R package (yellow
parallelogram and green rectangle in Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram}
and Panel a in Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). Acquired environmental
data can be exported to a comma separated value file for additional
analysis. Quality assurance (QA) flags are reported as an indicator
variable.

The second step is harmonizing the data to compute soil fluxes across
soil layers. This step consists of three different actions (blue
rectangles in Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram} and Panel b in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). If a given observation by NEON is
reported as not passing a quality assurance check, we applied a gap
filling method to replace that measurement with its monthly mean at that
same depth (Section~\ref{sec-gapfilling}). Belowground measurements of
soil water and soil temperature are then interpolated to the same depth
as soil CO\(_{2}\) measurements. The diffusivity
(Section~\ref{sec-compute-diffusivity}) and soil flux across different
soil layers (Section~\ref{sec-compute-soil-flux}) are then computed.

The third and final step is computing a surface soil flux through
extrapolation to the surface (purple parallelogram in
Figure~\ref{fig-package-diagram} and Panel c in
Figure~\ref{fig-model-diagram}). Uncertainty on a soil flux measurement
is computed through quadrature. An aggregate quality assurance (QA) flag
for each environmental measurement is also reported, representing if any
gap-filled measurements were used in the computation of a soil flux.
Within the soil flux-gradient method, several different approaches can
be used to derive a surface flux (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014); the
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package reports four different possible values for
soil surface flux (Section~\ref{sec-compute-soil-flux}).

\subsubsection{Gap-filling routine}\label{sec-gapfilling}

NEON reports QA flags as a binary value for a given measurement and
half-hourly time interval. We replaced any flagged measurements at a
location's spatial depth \(z\) with a bootstrapped sample of the monthly
mean for all un-flagged measurements for that month. These measurements
are represented by the vector \(\mathbf{m}\), standard errors
\(\boldsymbol\sigma\), and the 95\% confidence interval (the so-called
expanded uncertainty, Farrance \& Frenkel (2012))
\(\boldsymbol\epsilon\). All of these vectors have length \(M\). We have
that \(\vec{\sigma}_{i}\leq\vec{\epsilon}_{i}\). We define the bias as
\(\mathbf{b}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol\epsilon^{2}-\boldsymbol\sigma^{2}}\).

We generate a vector of bootstrap samples of the distribution of the
monthly mean \(\overline{\boldsymbol{m}}\) and monthly standard error
\(\overline{\boldsymbol\sigma}\) the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Randomly sample from the uncertainty and bias independently:
  \(\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}\) and the bias \(\mathbf{b}_{k}\) (not
  necessarily the same sample).
\item
  Generate a vector \(\mathbf{n}\) of length \(N\), where
  \(\mathbf{n}_{i}\) is a random sample from a normal distribution with
  mean \(\boldsymbol{m}_{i}\) and standard deviation
  \(\boldsymbol\sigma_{j}\). Since \(M<N\), values from \(\mathbf{m}\)
  will be reused.
\item
  With these \(N\) random samples,
  \(\overline{y}_{i}=\overline{\vec{x}}+\vec{b}_{k}\) and \(s_{i}\) is
  the sample standard deviation of \(\vec{x}\). We expect that
  \(s_{i} \approx \vec{\sigma}_{j}\).
\item
  The reported monthly mean and standard deviation are then computed
  \(\overline{\overline{y}}\) and \(\overline{s}\). Measurements and
  uncertainties that did not pass the QA check are then substituted with
  \(\overline{\overline{y}}\) and \(\overline{s}\).
\end{enumerate}

This gap-filling method described here provides a consistent approach
for each data stream, however we recognize that other gap-filling
alternatives may be warranted for longer-term gaps (e.g.~such as
correlations with other NEON measurement levels and soil plots), or
measurement specific gap-filling routines. We discuss the effect of
gap-filling on our measurements in Section~\ref{sec-discussion}.

\subsubsection{Soil diffusivity}\label{sec-compute-diffusivity}

Soil diffusivity \(D_{a}\) at a given measurement depth is the product
of the diffusivity in free air \(D_{a,0}\) (m\(^{2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) and
the tortuosity \(\xi\) (no units) (Millington \& Shearer, 1971).

We compute \(D_{a,0}\) with Equation \ref{eq:da0}:

\begin{equation}
  D_{a,0} = 0.0000147 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{i} + 273.15}{293.15} \right)^{1.75} \cdot \left( \frac{P}{101.3} \right)
  \label{eq:da0}
\end{equation}

where \(T_{i}\) is soil temperature (\(^\circ\)C) at depth \(i\)
(National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024d) and \(P\)
surface barometric pressure (kPa) (National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON), 2024a).

Previous studies by Sallam et al. (1984) and Tang et al. (2003)
demonstrated the sensitivity of modeled \(F_{S}\) depending on the
tortuousity model used to compute diffusivity. At low soil water
content, the choice of tortusoity model may lead to order of magnitude
differences in \(D_{a}\), which in turn affect modeled \(F_{S}\). The
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} package uses two different models for \(\xi\),
representing the extremes reported in Sallam et al. (1984). The first
approach uses the Millington-Quirk model for diffusivity, Equation
\ref{eq:tortuosity-mq} (Millington \& Shearer, 1971):

\begin{equation}
  \xi = \frac{(\phi - SWC_{i})^{10/3}}{\phi^{2}}
  \label{eq:tortuosity-mq}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:tortuosity-mq}, \(SWC\) is the soil water content at
depth \(i\) (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024e) and
\(\phi\) is the porosity (Equation \ref{eq:porosity}), which in turn is
a function of soil physical properties (National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON), 2024c):

\begin{equation}
  \phi = \left(1- \frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{m}} \right) \left(1-f_{V}\right)
  \label{eq:porosity}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:porosity}, \(\rho_{m}\) is the particle density of
mineral soil (2.65 g cm\(^{-3}\)), \(\rho_{s}\) the soil bulk density (g
cm\(^{-3}\)) excluding coarse fragments greater than 2 mm (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024c). The term \(f_{V}\) is a
site-specific value that accounts for the proportion of soil fragments
between 2-20 mm. Soil fragments greater than 20 mm were not estimated
due to limitations in the amount of soil that can be analyzed (National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 2024c). We assume there are no
pores within rocks.

The second approach to calculate \(\xi\) is the Marshall model
(Marshall, 1959), where \(\xi = \phi^{1.5}\), with \(\phi\) defined from
Equation \ref{eq:porosity}.

\subsubsection{Soil flux computation}\label{sec-compute-soil-flux}

We applied Fick's law (Equation \ref{eq:ficks}) to compute the soil flux
\(F_{ij}\) (\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) across two soil depths
\(i\) and \(j\):

\begin{equation}
  F_{ij} = -D_{a} \frac{dC}{dz}
  \label{eq:ficks}
\end{equation}

where \(D_{a}\) is the diffusivity (m\(^{2}\) s\(^{-1}\)) and
\(\frac{dC}{dz}\) is the gradient of CO\(_{2}\) molar concentration
(\(\mu\)mol m\(^{-3}\), so the gradient has units of \(\mu\)mol
m\(^{-3}\) m\(^{-1}\)). The soil surface flux is theoretically defined
by applying Equation \ref{eq:ficks} to measurements collected at the
soil surface and directly below the surface. Measurements of soil
temperature, soil water content, and soil CO\(_{2}\) molar concentration
across the soil profile allow for application of Equation \ref{eq:ficks}
across different soil depths. Each site had three measurement layers, so
we denote the flux between which two layers as a three-digit subscript
\(F_{ijk}\) with indicator variables \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) indicate if
a given layer was used (written in order of increasing depth), according
to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(F_{000}\) is a surface flux estimate using the intercept of the
  linear regression of \(D_{a}\) with depth and the slope from the
  linear regression of CO\(_{2}\) with depth (which represents
  \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dz}\) in Fick's Law). Tang et al. (2003)
  used this approach to compute fluxes in an oak-grass savannah.
\item
  \(F_{110}\), \(F_{011}\) are fluxes across the two most shallow layers
  and two deepest layers respectively. The diffusivity used in Fick's
  Law is always at the deeper measurement layer. When used as a surface
  flux estimate we assume CO\(_{2}\) remains constant above this flux
  depth.
\item
  \(F_{101}\) is a surface flux estimate using linear extrapolation
  using concentration measurements between the shallowest and deepest
  measurement layer. Hirano et al. (2003) and Tang et al. (2005) used an
  approach similar to \(F_{101}\) in a temperate deciduous broadleaf
  forest and ponderosa pine forest respectively.
\end{itemize}

Uncertainty in all \(F_{ijk}\) is computed through quadrature (Taylor,
2022).

\subsection{Post processing evaluation}\label{sec-post-process}

Following collection of field measurements and calculation of the soil
fluxes from \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package, we compared measured
\(F_{S}\) based on closed-dynamic chamber measurements with the LI-COR
instruments to a given soil flux calculation from \texttt{neonSoilFlux}
for each site and flux computation method. Statistics included the
associated R\(^{2}\) value, root mean squared error (RMSE), and signal
to noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of a modeled soil flux
(\(F_{ijk}\)) from \texttt{neonSoilFlux} to its quadrature uncertainty
(\(\sigma_{ijk}\)).

We observed that the range of values (e.g.~\(F_{ijk} \pm \sigma_{ijk}\)
was much larger than the measured field flux. We evaluated
\(| F_{S} - F_{ijk} | < (1-\epsilon) \sigma_{ijk}\), where \(F_{S}\) is
a measured field soil flux from the LI-COR 6800 (as the LI-COR 870/8250
was used at only three sites in 2024 but the 6800 was used at all sites
in both years). The parameter \(\epsilon\) was an uncertainty reduction
factor to evaluate how much the quadrature uncertainty could be reduced
while maintaining precision between modeled \(F_{ijk}\) and measured
\(F_{S}\).

Finally, for a half-hourly interval we also computed a \emph{post hoc}
\(D_{a}\) using the LI-COR flux along with the CO\(_{2}\) surface
gradient reported by NEON using the measurement levels closest to the
surface.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The timeseries of the measured fluxes from the LI-COR 6800 and 870/8250
were compared to modeled soil fluxes from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R
package (Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results}). We also assessed year-long
estimated flux time series and compared those field measurements for
each measurement site (Figure~\ref{fig-flux-results-year}). Results are
reported in local time. Positive values of the flux indicate that there
is a flux moving towards the surface. For ease of clarity the fluxes at
\(F_{111}\) and \(F_{000}\) are only shown in the top row (surface),
followed by the fluxes at individual separate layers (\(F_{100}\),
\(F_{010}\), \(F_{001}\)). Overall, with the exception of WREF and SRER
(discussed later) the computed fluxes determined using a variety of
plausible methods spanned the measured field fluxes.

Table~\ref{tbl-r2-table} compares statistics of the modeled soil fluxes
to field \(F_{S}\) at each site. As \texttt{neonSoilFlux} models
half-hourly fluxes, we considered all measured fluxes over the duration
of the half-hourly interval when computing the normalized root mean
square error (NRMSE), \(R^{2}\), at each of the flux methods
(\(F_{000}\), \(F_{110}\), \(F_{011}\), \(F_{101}\)) for the diffusivity
models studied (Millington-Quirk or Marshall).

For a given half-hourly time period, the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} packages
assigns a QA flag for a measurement if more one values across all
measurement depths uses gap-filled data (Section~\ref{sec-gapfilling}).
Panel a of Figure~\ref{fig-gap-filled-stats} reports the distribution
for all input environmental measurements at each site when field
measurements were made. Soil fluxes are computed from 4 different types
of input measurements (\(T_{S}\), \(SWC\), \(P\), and CO\(_{2}\)), any
of which could have a QA flag in a half-hourly interval. Panel b of
Figure~\ref{fig-gap-filled-stats} displays at each site the distribution
of the number of different gap-filled measurements used to compute a
half-hourly flux. The largest contribution to gap-filled measurements
was soil water. SJER and WOOD utilized the largest number of gap-filled
measurements, which were primarily \(SWC\) and \(T_{S}\).

Figure~\ref{fig-uncertainty-stats} reports both the computed SNR and the
proportion of measured field fluxes within the modeled uncertainty for a
given flux computation method \(F_{ijk}\)
(Section~\ref{sec-post-process}). Here, values of SNR greater than unity
indicates a reported uncertainty is smaller, propogated by quadrature
from a relatively higher precision from measured input variables
(CO\(_{2}\), \(T_{S}\), \(SWC\), or \(P\)). The sensitivity to the
uncertainty reduction factor (\(\epsilon\), bottom panels in
Figure~\ref{fig-uncertainty-stats}) demonstrates how accuracy could be
improved if modeled uncertainty \(\sigma_{ijk}\) decreases.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

This study presents a unified data science workflow to efficiently
process automated measurements of belowground soil CO\(_{2}\)
concentrations, water, and temperature to infer estimates of soil
surface CO\(_{2}\) effluxes through application of Fick's Law (Equation
\ref{eq:ficks}). Our core goals in this study were: (1) to generate
estimates of soil flux from continuous soil sensor data at terrestrial
NEON sites using the flux-gradient method and then (2) to compare those
estimates to field-measured fluxes based on the closed chamber approach
at six NEON focal sites. We discuss our progress toward these core goals
through (1) an overall evaluation of the flux-gradient approach (and
uncertainty calculation) and (2) site-specific evaluation of differences
in estimated vs measured fluxes.

\subsection{General evaluation of flux-gradient
approach}\label{general-evaluation-of-flux-gradient-approach}

Key assumptions of the flux-gradient approach are that CO\(_{2}\)
concentrations increase throughout the soil profile. We found that this
condition was met at XXX\% across the study period. Periods where this
gradient condition are not met generally are connected to biophysical
processes such soil wetting events (e.g.~KONZ), which have the effect of
reducing the soil respiration or efflux due to a temporary reduction in
diffusivity. When modeling soil respiration, typically a non-linear
response function that also considers soil type is used (Bouma \& Bryla,
2000; Yan et al., 2016, 2018). For the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package,
soil type is connected to the bulk density, which was characterized at
each NEON site based on replicate samples collected from the site
megapit at a subset of soil horizons, with an estimated uncertainty of
\(\pm5\%\) (see NEON User Guide to Soil physical and chemical
properties, Megapit (DP1.00096.001)). Coarse fragment estimates also
have very large uncertainties, but because the volume fraction tends to
be low in surface soils it probably wouldn't contribute much additional
flux uncertainty.

The largest source of uncertainty to improve reliability of the flux
estimate is to prevent the usage of gap-filled data. Three sites (KONZ,
SRER, and KONZ) had more than 75\% of half-hourly periods with no-gap
filled measurements. Two sites (SJER and WOOD) had more than 75\% of
half-hourly intervals with just one gap-filled measurement. While WREF
reported no gap-filled measurements, field data collection occurred
following a once-in-a century rainstorm with soils observed at their
water holding capacity. We recommend that whenever available, local
field knowledge is supplementary to any QA filtering protocol of fluxes
from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package.

We recognize that this gap-filling approach may lead to gap-filled
values that are quite different from the actual values, such as an
underestimate of soil moisture following rain events. Further extensions
of the gap filling method could use more sophisticated gap-filling
routines, similar to what is used for net ecosystem carbon exchange
(Falge et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2023; Mariethoz et al., 2015; Moffat et
al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2023). The current gap-filling routine provides
a consistent approach that can be applied to each data stream, but
further work may explore alternative gap-filling approaches.

Based on this approach, we would \emph{a priori} expect
\(F_{011} \leq F_{101} \leq \leq F_{110} \leq F_{000}\) because the
previous flux estimates ones correspond to deeper depths which will
could miss CO\(_{2}\) produced in shallower layers. Additionally, field
flux measurements should correlate with \(F_{000}\) because they
represent surface fluxes.

\subsection{Evaluation of flux-gradient approach at each
site}\label{evaluation-of-flux-gradient-approach-at-each-site}

Derived results from the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package have patterns
that are consistent, and comparable, to those directly measured to the
field (Figure XXX). The advantage to the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package
is the calculation of fluxes across different measurement depths,
allowing for additional site-specific customization. Here application of
the flux-gradient method provides a baseline estimate of soil fluxes
that could be complemented through additional field measurements
(e.g.~LICOR).

The six sites studied provide separate case studies for considerations
when applying the flux-gradient method to evaluate resulting
uncertainties and fluxes For example, SRER is characterized by sandy
soil, which also led to the highest observed field soil temperatures. At
SRER the flux across the top two layers (\(F_{110}\)) produced a pattern
of soil flux consistent with the observed field data. The remaining
methods \(F_{101}\), \(F_{011}\), or \(F_{000}\) are derived from
information at the deeper layer, which is decoupled both in terms of
temperature and CO\(_{2}\) concentration.

In addition, KONZ is a site that experienced a significant rain event
prior to sampling with eventual drying out over the course of the
experiment. In this case we observed storage of soil water which
increased the soil CO\(_{2}\) at the top layer, leading to negative
values of flux at the start of the experiment, with the fluxes drying
out afterwards. In this case only when the soil dried out (or returned
to a baseline level), that the fluxes at the provided layer would work
out in this case.

When considering systematic deployment of this method across a
measurement network, we faced a number of independent challenges for
consideration.

Figure~\ref{fig-uncertainty-stats} illustrates the tradeoff between
accuracy for modeled fluxes (defined here as closeness to field-measured
\(F_{S}\)) and precision defined by the SNR, and how this is confounded
by the choice of diffusivity model used. MORE HERE

Diffusivity discussion

In developing and validating our approach, we faced a number of
challenges related to data availability, including\ldots{} gap filling,
sensor calibration, depth interpolation, rainstorms, etc These errors
are all

\subsection{Recommendations for future method
development}\label{recommendations-for-future-method-development}

The \texttt{neonSoilFlux} package provides three different approaches of
values for a soil flux. We believe these approaches reflect a variety of
site-specific determination and assumptions used to generate a soil flux
measurement (Maier \& Schack-Kirchner, 2014), with the choice of method
having a determinative approach on reported values. Reported results
could further be distilled down using ensemble averaging averaging
approaches (Elshall et al., 2018; Raftery et al., 2005).

Figures XXX suggests that the provided uncertainty from
\texttt{neonSoilFlux} is an overestimate compared to what is actually
computed. When \(\epsilon=0\) in Figure
Figure~\ref{fig-uncertainty-stats}, that means we are just using the
reported uncertainty from neonSoilFlux. Looking at that (epsilon = 0)
shows field measurements UNDE, KONZ, SJER are 100\% within the reported
intervals from neonSoilFlux. But those sites tend to have a SNR
\textless{} 1, so the uncertainty is pretty noisy. For UNDE, we could
even reduce the uncertainty by a factor of 75\% (epsilon = 0.75), more
than half of the field measurements will still be within the reported
intervals. For KONZ, we are still within 70\% of the reported intervals
when uncertainty is reduced by 90\%. That suggests that while the
reported accuracy (as compared to field measurements), we do have higher
precision.

These challenges notwithstanding, the method used here and made
available in the \texttt{neonSoilFlux} R package has the potential to
produce nearly continuous estimates of flux across all terrestrial NEON
sites. These estimates are a significant improvement on available
approaches to constrain the portion of ecosystem respiration
attributable to the soil. This, in turn, aids in our ability to
understand the components of net ecosystem flux assessed at these sites
using the co-located eddy flux towers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Refine estimates to provide a realistic constraint on surface
  concentration measurements, thereby increasing the gradient.
\item
  Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g.~random trees) or model
  averaging techniques to generate a single flux estimate across each

\item
  Benchmarking flux results to estimates provided by Net ecosystem
  carbon exchange.

measurements across terrestrial National Ecological Observatory Network
sites. We compared the predicted fluxes to those measured directly using
a field-based closed chamber approach. We find that\ldots{}
